[**Ghidra**](https://ghidra-sre.org/)

Developed by the United States National Security Agency, Ghidra is an open-source suite of analysis tools that includes disassembly, assembly, and decompilation functions. It is highly configurable and supports a wide range of processor architectures.

[**IDA Pro**](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/)

IDA Pro is an industry-leading tool for binary code analysis. While primarily known for its disassembly capabilities, it also offers limited decompilation capabilities through the Hex-Rays Decompiler plugin, highly valued for its precision and analysis capabilities.

[**Radare2**](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2)

Radare2 is an open-source reverse engineering suite that offers disassembly, malware analysis, debugging, and decompilation capabilities. It is highly modular and can be used through a command-line interface or through its Cutter graphical interface.

[**RetDec**](https://github.com/avast/retdec)

RetDec is an open-source decompiler developed by Avast that is capable of converting compiled machine code into human-readable C code. It is easy to integrate into reverse engineering workflows and malware analysis.

[**JEB Decompiler**](https://www.pnfsoftware.com/)

JEB Decompiler is a commercial tool known for its precision and effectiveness in decompiling machine code into Java, Dalvik, and other language code. It is widely used in the cybersecurity industry and mobile application reverse engineering.

[**SmartBear**](https://smartbear.com/)

SmartBear offers TestComplete, which allows auditing fields and spaces directly while they are being executed. It provides insights into the application's state or metadata during runtime. However, it's important to note that there might be some limitations in terms of what can be audited or accessed during execution.

[**Spy++**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/downloads/?cid=learn-navbar-download-cta)

Spy++ is a part of Microsoft Visual Studio, providing developers with the capability to inspect and audit the current state of a system. It's particularly useful for finding fields and understanding the behavior of applications. Once Visual Studio is installed, Spy++ can be accessed through the "spyxx" file. Different versions of Spy++ are available depending on the operating system being used.

[**JetBrains dotPeek**](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/decompiler/)

dotPeek by JetBrains is an excellent decompiler specifically tailored for compiled ".NET" files. It allows developers to decompile and analyze .NET assemblies, providing insights into the source code even if it's not readily available. dotPeek is widely used for reverse engineering .NET applications and understanding their internal workings.
