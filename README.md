[JetBrains dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/)

Excellent solution for compiled ".NET" files.

[IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/)

Tool for binary analysis. Sometimes it's possible to determine the original language used for compilation and obtain metadata, variables, and states of a compiled program.

[SmartBear](https://support.smartbear.com/testcomplete/docs/licensing/index.html)

Allows auditing fields and spaces directly while they are being executed. It has some limitations, but sometimes it's possible to obtain states or metadata of an application.

[Spy++](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Part of Visual Studio, it allows finding fields and auditing the current state of a system. Once Visual Studio is installed, it can be accessed through the "spyxx" file, which has different versions depending on the active system.
